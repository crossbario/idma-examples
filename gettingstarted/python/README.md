# XBR Buyer and Seller in Python

This folder contains examples for simple XBR seller and buyer delegates written in Python,
and using [Autobahn|Python](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python).

## Getting started

### Registering in the XBR Network

To run the examples, you need to be registered in the [XBR Network](https://xbr.network/).

Registering is free and you don't need any crypto (Ether or tokens). But you will need a crypto
wallet, specifically, the only supported wallet currently is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
After installing MetaMask (in Chrome or FireFox), please visit [https://planet.xbr.network/](https://planet.xbr.network/) to register.

### Joining the IDMA Data Market

The XBR Network consists of potentially many XBR data markets, and to buy or sell data in a given market,
you need to join that market and accept the market user terms.

To join the data market we've created for the IDMA contests, please visit the [IDMA market homepage](https://planet.xbr.network/market/1388ddf6fe364201b1aacb7e36b4cfb3).
